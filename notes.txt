# ----------------------------------------
#  Getting started
# ----------------------------------------
# Create a container in detached mode (-d) and (-p) map port 80 of host to port 80 of container.
# This automatically downloads an image and starts a container.
# A container is just another process on the host that is isolated.
# A container image is the filesystem that is used to run a container.
# Use docker desktop to monitor status of containers and images.
docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started

# If the Docker daemon is not running, open Powershell with Admin privileges and execute
& 'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe' -SwitchDaemon

# Change location where docker stores container images.

# ----------------------------------------
#  Creating your own image
# ----------------------------------------
# Sample to do list app is located here:
http://localhost/assets/app.zip

# A Dockerfile is a list of text instructions on how to construct an image.
# Create Dockerfile in directory containing application.
# Build a container called getting-started and use the Dockerfile in this directory.
docker build -t getting-started .

# Run the image
docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started

# ----------------------------------------
#  Managing containers
# ----------------------------------------
# List all running containers
docker ps

# Kill a container
docker rm container-id -force

# Inspect container logs
docker logs -f container-id

# Start bash temrinal for container
docker exec -it container-id bash
docker exec -it container-id sh

# ----------------------------------------
#  Volumes and persisting container data
# ----------------------------------------
# Volumes connect a part of the container filesystem to the host machine's file system.
# It is used to persist data that is created/updated/deleted on the container.
# Create a volume
docker volume create db

# Run while mounting a volume (named volume)
docker run -dp 3000:3000 -v volume-name:/path/to/mount getting-started
docker run -dp 3000:3000 -v db:/etc/todos getting-started

# Inspect a volume
# On a windows system, it is stored in \\wsl$\docker-desktop-data\data\docker\volumes
docker volume inspect volume-name

# -w sets working directory of container
# -v "/path/to/source/data:/path/to/mount" specifies the source and destination paths of the bind mount.
# node:12-alpine is the image.
# The following command is used to setup a development container to develop node.js applications
docker run -dp 3000:3000 `
    -w /app -v "$(pwd):/app" `
    node:12-alpine `
    sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev"
